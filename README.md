# ðŸ§  Single Layer Neural Network for Binary Classification

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of a **single-layer neural network** (perceptron) built entirely from scratch using **NumPy**.  
It demonstrates how a neuron can learn to classify binary data through **forward propagation**, **cost computation**, and **gradient descent optimization**.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Pure NumPy implementation â€” **no TensorFlow / PyTorch / Scikit-learn**
- Step-by-step explanation of:
  - Forward propagation
  - Cost function (Binary Cross-Entropy)
  - Gradient descent optimization
- Visualizations of cost reduction over iterations
- Works for any binary classification dataset
